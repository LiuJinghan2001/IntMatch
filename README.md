# Int*-Match: Balancing Intra-Class Compactness and Inter-Class Discrepancy for Semi-Supervised Speaker Recognition
This repository contains the code for our paper: "Int*-Match: Balancing Intra-Class Compactness and Inter-Class Discrepancy for Semi-Supervised Speaker Recognition" (Accepted by AAAI 2025). We propose a novel method to control the variation of the inter-class confidence threshold, thereby improving the performance of speaker recognition. The code will be organized and uploaded shortly.

# Acknowledge

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the following teams and individuals for their open-source contributions, which have greatly assisted our work:

1. [TorchSSL](https://github.com/TorchSSL/TorchSSL) and [USB](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning) for helping us better understand semi-supervised learning algorithms.
2. [ECAPA-TDNN](https://github.com/TaoRuijie/ECAPA-TDNN) by Tao, which has been instrumental in building our speaker recognition system.
