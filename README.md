# Int*-Match: Balancing Intra-Class Compactness and Inter-Class Discrepancy for Semi-Supervised Speaker Recognition
This repository contains the code for our paper: "Int*-Match: Balancing Intra-Class Compactness and Inter-Class Discrepancy for Semi-Supervised Speaker Recognition" (Accepted by AAAI 2025). We propose a novel method to control the variation of the inter-class confidence threshold, thereby improving the performance of speaker recognition. The code will be organized and uploaded shortly.
